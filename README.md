# graphql-express-example

An example implementation of graphQL on an express server with a React app.

## Running the server

The app can be run with `npm run start` -- this uses the webpack dev server.
The GraphQL server can be run with `npm run start:server` - this must be built first with `npm run build:server` to capture any changes.
